            Audio features could influence popularity. dB(loudness), danceability, valence, acousticness and bpm have positive relationships with popularity.
Duration, liveness, energy and speechiness have negative relationships with popularity. However, the relationships are not very strong. <i>(See image below)</i>

            Analysis and Recommendations:
            A new artist should start with English songs considering that English 
is a dominant language.
A new artist should start with dance pop songs because there is a 
huge market of dance pop songs.
A song with high danceability, high acousticness, low energy and 
short duration is a good choice for a new artist.

        <div class="right"> <h3>Motown Records:</h3> <i>James</i> is a driven and ambitious A&R for Motown Records.
He is eager to make his mark on the company and secure a promotion.
In order to do so, he decides to carefully study the top songs of the last decade in order to
replicate the winning formula used by other successful labels, Atlantic and Interscope.
Armed with this knowledge, he sets out to find the next big artist and a hit song for Motown
simultaneously starting his legacy.
James begins his research by analyzing the top 20 artists from the United States, Canada, and
the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2019. He finds that Katy Perry is the top artist, followed by
Rhianna. In third place, there is a three-way tie between Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, and Maroon
5.

James continues his research and discovers that 57% of the songs created by artists belong to
the Dance-Pop genre. This is an interesting finding, as it suggests that Dance-Pop is a
dominant and successful genre in the present music industry.
Based on his findings, James decides to further investigate the popularity of Dance-Pop over
the last decade. He discovers that 55% of the top songs of the last decade belonged to this
genre. Additionally, he observes that Dance-Pop had popular songs every year from 2010 to
2019. This suggests that the popularity of Dance-Pop is not just a temporary trend, but rather a
consistent and enduring phenomenon in the music industry.
He notices that songs released in 2019 are more popular than those released between 2010
and 2018. This piques his curiosity and he begins to wonder what factors are most important in
determining a song's popularity. He decides to conduct further research and analysis to better
understand the underlying factors that drive a song's success.
James decides to meet with a legendary music producer and conduct a joint analysis of popular
songs. They find that loudness and danceability have the most significant positive impact on a
song's popularity. Valence, acousticness, and beats per minute (BPM) also have positive
relationships with popularity. Additionally, they observe that lower energy levels are associated
with increased popularity.
James noticed that factors such as duration, liveness, energy, and speeches all had a negative
impact on a song's popularity. He made note of these findings and plans to share them with
Motown's lead music producer to ensure that their songs avoid these negative factors
He found that the easier a song was to dance to, the more popular it tended to be. The same
was true for songs with high acousticness. He also noted that in the current era of short
attention spans, long song durations were seen as a negative. Audiences tended to prefer
shorter songs.

After conducting extensive research and analysis, James has developed a formula for success:
<ul>
<li>His artist should primarily make songs in English, due to English being the dominant
language in popular songs.</li>
<li> Due to the significant success of Dance-Pop songs in the past decade, the artist should
focus on this genre.</li>
<li>To maximize popularity, the artist's first song should have high acoustic tones, low
energy, and short duration. Additionally, it should be easy to dance to.</li>
