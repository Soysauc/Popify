# Welcome to Popify by The Music Junkies

This is a website that was developed conceptually between a team of 4 that merged the disciplines of software engineering and data science + analytics.
I worked extensively switching up a lot of the design based on feedback from Practicum's own designers and feedback from the other SE.

## The importance of Data

The dataset included here is based on the most popular songs from Spotify during the 2010s, hence why the color scheme and logo are satire in nature. The project is a visual essay of the data set inspired by spotify.

### Web technologies

Other than HEAVY CSS what is also included here is Chart.JS, an opensource Javascript Library that showcases different charts that the user and developer can manipulate. I chose the graphs based on the Jupyter Notebook file given by the Data Science students on the team.
